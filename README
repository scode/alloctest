= Trivial allocation test =

Allocates memory with malloc or mmap and fills in. Prompts for user
entering enter in between allocation and filling.

Weird use-cases include forcing the freebsd kernel to release
otherwise cached data to make room for the ZFS ARC, and testing what
counts towards resident set size.
