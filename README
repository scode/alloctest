= Trivial allocation test =

Allocates memory with malloc or mmap and fills in. Prompts for user
entering enter in between allocation and filling.

Weird use-cases include forcing the freebsd kernel to release
otherwise cached data to make room for the ZFS ARC, and testing what
counts towards resident set size.

Tested on FreeBSD and Debian.

== Usage ==

Build:

  make

Run:

  ./alloctest malloc 100
  ./alloctest mmap-write ./bigfile 100
  ./alloctest mmap-read ./bigfile 100
